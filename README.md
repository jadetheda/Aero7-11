# Aero7-11
Aero 7 theme for Windows 11 23H2+

## Notes

THE uDWM patch folder labeled 21H2 will NOT work on 21H2. It should be for 22H2!

This is made on the default aero.msstyles in Windows 11. This was made and tested on Windows 11 23H2 and 24H2.
>[!TIP]
>When using OpenGlass, if OpenGlass is started before the Windhawk mod the accent color will show. However, if OpenGlass starts (or restarts) after the Windhawk mod is active, the color will not show on borders.
>If you are not using OpenGlass or DWMBlurGlass, disable the Mica or Acrylic effects in MicaForEveryone, and set your accent color to show on title bars and borders in Settings.

If you want the borders, you should go into Windhawk's advanced settings and add dwm.exe to the include list.

>[!WARNING]
>I recommend using light app mode and dark Windows mode. This does *NOT* have support for dark app mode. The Windows mode is unaffected, but most taskbar mods work better on dark base than light base.

Here's the theme in action. As you can see, it's not 1:1, and unfortunately due to issues I won't be able to make it 1:1 with my current tool.

## Credits

This theme is "Open Source" in that it is open for anyone to use and edit. I do not place any restrictions or payment on this.

Anyone can create a copy or redistribute this. However, the only stipulation is that it must remain free and that all of the following people must be credited for their contributions to Windows customization:

 - teknixstuff: Created the original "Bring Back the Borders!" mod on Windhawk, based on Ittr's uDWM patches.
 - Zee-Ay (Za9-118): Contibuted the Shellstyle dll, and created the Vista Theme.
 - vaporvance: Created the Shellstyle dll in the original Aero10 theme.
 - Ittr: Created the uDWM.dll patch included.
 - SandTechStuff: Updated instuctions for readability.
 - TheDolphinSlayer: Added the Windows 7 alt tab resources.
 - All Windows 7 Aero theme for Windows 10/11 developers: I took bits from various such themes.

I cannot take credit for this theme, except in a few very places. I just took the Windows 7 designs, merged them with the Windows 11 aero.msstyles, then put everything into one place to implement it. I do this with the hope that it will help Windows 11 user looking for a good Windows 7 theme for their system.
